ansible all -m shell -a "apt install git" //permission denied since no sudo used
ansible all -m shell -a "sudo apt install git" //will work since we have used sudo
ansible all -m shell -a "apt install git" -b //will work since we have used -b ie become sudo
ansible all -m copy -a "src=hellofile dest=/home/sysops"
