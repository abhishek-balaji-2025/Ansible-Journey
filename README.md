# Ansible Journey

## Why Ansible Came Into Existence

In modern infrastructure, managing hundreds of servers manually is not only time-consuming but also highly error-prone. Imagine having multiple EC2 instances running frontend, backend, and database services. Now, if a DevOps engineer needs to update configurations or deploy changes across all these instances, doing it manually via SSH is inefficient and goes against the core principles of DevOps—**automation**, **consistency**, and **speed**.

This is where **Ansible** comes into the picture.

Ansible is an open-source **configuration management**, **automation**, and **orchestration** tool designed to simplify IT infrastructure tasks. It allows you to define your infrastructure as code using simple, human-readable **YAML playbooks**, and apply those configurations across multiple servers at once—quickly, reliably, and securely.

Unlike other tools, Ansible is:
- **Agentless**: Communicates over SSH—no additional software required on target machines.
- **Idempotent**: Ensures tasks produce the same result, no matter how many times you run them.
- **Easy to Learn**: Uses plain YAML syntax for defining tasks and roles.
- **Widely Adopted**: Trusted and used by companies around the world to manage complex infrastructure.

This repository documents my learning journey with Ansible—from basics to advanced use cases. Whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding, I hope this repo helps you along the way!
